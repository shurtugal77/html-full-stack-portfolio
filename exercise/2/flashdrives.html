            <p>
              LaCie’s rugged external hard drives are a favorite among content
              creators who are always out on the field. It’s drop, shock, dust,
              and rain-resistant, making it ideal for surviving the elements
              when you’re out in nature. It comes in different types and
              connectivity as well, with the Thunderbolt/USB-C option being
              ideal for MacBook and Dell XPS users, and the RAID option being
              perfect for creative professionals. Because it comes with up to
              8TB, you can also pick and choose depending on your storage needs.

            <h3><a href="https://www.seagate.com/de/de/products/external-hard-drives/backup-plus/" target="_blank">Seagate Backup Plus - The Best Performance</a></h3>
            <p>
              If you want to combine speed and capacity, then the Seagate Backup
              Plus Desktop Drive 5TB is definitely worth considering. It comes
              in a range of sizes up to 8TB and it beats the competition when it
              comes to read and write speeds as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              On top of this storage and speed, you get a decent amount of peace
              of mind thanks to Seagate's lower than average failure rates,
              especially in bigger capacity hard drives.

            <h3><a href="https://www.samsung.com/de/memory-storage/portable-ssd/portable-ssd-t5-1tb-black-mu-pa1t0b-eu/" target="_blank">Samsung T5 SSD - The Best SSD</a></h3>
            <p>
              If you'd rather have an external hard drive that takes advantage
              of solid state drive (SSD) speeds, then the Samsung Portable SSD
              T5 is certainly among the best external hard drive for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Samsung has an excellent reputation for external SSDs, thanks to
              products like the T3, and the T5 builds on its predecessor by
              adding a fast USB Type-C connection that ekes out every last drop
              of performance from the solid state drive inside. Of course, it's
              also backwards compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 if your PC
              doesn't have USB Type-C. Be prepared to shell out a bit more cash,
              but it’s well worth it.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Buying the best external hard drive for your needs involves figuring
            out how much space you need. You don't want to buy an external hard
            drive that's too small, end up running out of space and buying
            another one. However, you also don’t want to pay over the odds for
            storage space you'll never need.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the best external hard drives must also be dependable
            and rugged, so you can safely store your data without worry. The
            best external drives must also be light enough to carry in your bag,
            with large capacities so that you can keep your data safe when
            traveling.
